# SMH-Soil-Moisture-Sensor

Simple and reliable sensor SMH-01 defines the amount of plant available water by measuring the capillary pressure at the location of the sensor.
[SMH-01](https://github.com/greensensors/SMH-Soil-Moisture-Sensor/blob/main/SMH-01.png) has a waterproof housing. 
SMT-01 provides measurement of parameters in a wide temperature range and in soils of different composition with high stability. 
SMT-01 is compatible with various microcontrollers and has a shielded cable.
